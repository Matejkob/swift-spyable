/// The `CalledFactory` is designed to generate a representation of a Swift variable
/// declaration to track if a certain function has been called.
///
/// The resulting variable's of type Bool and its name is constructed by appending
/// the word "Called" to the `variablePrefix` parameter. This variable uses a getter
/// that checks whether another variable (with the name `variablePrefix` + "CallsCount")
/// is greater than zero. If so, the getter returns true, indicating the function has been called,
/// otherwise it returns false.
///
/// > Important: The factory assumes the existence of a variable named `variablePrefix + "CallsCount"`,
/// which should keep track of the number of times a function has been called.
///
/// The following code:
/// ```swift
/// var fooCalled: Bool {
///     return fooCallsCount > 0
/// }
/// ```
/// would be generated for a function like this:
/// ```swift
/// func foo()
/// ```
/// and an argument `variablePrefix` equal to `foo`.
